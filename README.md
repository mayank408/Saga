SAGA - Smart Automation and Grid Analysis

A web app made on JavaScript , for smart analysis and control of home appliances . Using Rasberry pi module we are sensing all the appliances present at home and allowing user to turn ON/OFF from the web app itself. This way we can control the consumption of elecricity.

The main feature of this app is anomaly detection , for ex if there is a sudden rise due to short circuit or gas leak , then it will immmediately send a push notification to the user as well the admin side of the app . Suh any casualities can be easily reported and sort out.
